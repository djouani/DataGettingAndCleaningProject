# Data Getting And Cleaning Project
## Course Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Runing the code 
1. Download the original data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Unzip 
3. run the code run.analysis.R 
4. a file tidy.txt will be generate din the actual directory 

## Dependency 
run.analysis.R depends on reshape2 and data.table packages.
